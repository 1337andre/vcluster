By default, vcluster will use [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) as virtual Kubernetes cluster, which is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.

However, vcluster also works with other Kubernetes distributions and k3s is not required. We recommend to use k3s, because it has a small footprint and widely adopted, but if your use case requires a different k8s distribution, you can exchange k3s with another distribution such as k0s or vanilla k8s.

## k0s

[k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s) is an all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster and packaged as a single binary for ease of use. vcluster supports k0s as backing virtual Kubernetes cluster.

In order to use k0s as backing cluster, create a `values.yaml` in the following form:

```
vcluster:
  # Replace this with the desired k0s version
  image: k0sproject/k0s:v1.22.4-k0s.0
  command: ["k0s"]
  baseArgs: 
    - controller
    - --config=/etc/k0s/config.yaml
    - --data-dir=/data/k0s
    - --disable-components=konnectivity-server,kube-scheduler,csr-approver,default-psp,kube-proxy,coredns,network-provider,helm,metrics-server,kubelet-config
  extraArgs: []
  volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /data
      name: data
    - mountPath: /etc/k0s
      name: k0s-config
      
syncer:
  extraArgs:
    - --request-header-ca-cert=/data/k0s/pki/ca.crt
    - --client-ca-cert=/data/k0s/pki/ca.crt
    - --server-ca-cert=/data/k0s/pki/ca.crt
    - --server-ca-key=/data/k0s/pki/ca.key
    - --kube-config=/data/k0s/pki/admin.conf

volumes:
  - name: k0s-config
    secret:
      secretName: k0s-config
      
secret:
  name: k0s-config
  data:
    config.yaml: |-
      apiVersion: k0s.k0sproject.io/v1beta1
      kind: Cluster
      metadata:
        name: k0s
      spec:
        api:
          port: 6443
          k0sApiPort: 9443
          extraArgs:
            enable-admission-plugins: NodeRestriction
        network:
          # Will be replaced automatically from the vcluster cli
          serviceCIDR: ##CIDR##
          provider: custom
        controllerManager:
          extraArgs:
            controllers: '*,-nodeipam,-nodelifecycle,-persistentvolume-binder,-attachdetach,-persistentvolume-expander,-cloud-node-lifecycle'
```

Now create the vcluster with:

```
vcluster create vcluster-1 -n host-namespace-1 -f values.yaml
```

Connect to the vcluster and start using it:
```
vcluster connect vcluster-1 -n host-namespace-1

# Then execute in a new terminal
export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get ns
...
```

Congrats, you have deployed vcluster with k0s as virtual Kubernetes cluster distribution!

## Vanilla k8s

Coming soon...
