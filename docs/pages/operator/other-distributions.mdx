By default, vcluster will use [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) as virtual Kubernetes cluster, which is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.

However, vcluster also works with other Kubernetes distributions and k3s is not required. We recommend to use k3s, because it has a small footprint and widely adopted, but if your use case requires a different k8s distribution, vcluster also supports k0s or vanilla k8s.

## k0s

[k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s) is an all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster and packaged as a single binary for ease of use. vcluster supports k0s as backing virtual Kubernetes cluster.

In order to use k0s as backing cluster, create a vcluster with the following command:

```
vcluster create vcluster-1 -n host-namespace-1 --distro k0s
```

Connect to the vcluster and start using it:
```
vcluster connect vcluster-1 -n host-namespace-1

# Then execute in a new terminal
export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get ns
...
```

Behind the scenes a different helm chart will be deployed (`vcluster-k0s`), that holds specific configuration to support k0s. 

## Vanilla k8s

Coming soon...
